        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            There is a parable of a business man in the 1920s, who approached
            a major corporation and bet them 1 million dollars that he could make
            all of their employees 30% more productive. The company took the bet,
            and the man handed out printed cards that had 3 checkboxes on them,
            told them to write down the 3 Most Important Things they needed to
            accomplish each day. Just 3. And keep it in front of them all day, and
            to check them off as they went. The story goes the production went up over
            50% and the man won the bet.

            True or fictional, the story speaks to something on human productivity.
            On a minute to minute, hour to hour basis, life happens. It is very easy
            to lost track of your goals and what you need to do. Writing down your
            3 Most Important Things or MITs, helps you keep some form of direction amidst
            the chaous of everyday life.

            The best way to use the site is to open it at the beginning of your day or workday,
            and set your 3 tasks for the day before life starts happening. Enter what is
            important for you; the 3 things you will be happy with yourself at the end
            of the day if you accomplished them. Then keep the site open and check them
            off as you complete them.

            The history portion of your site allows you to track your own productivity. It gives
            a record of all the days you have set goals, and how many of those goals you have completed
            as a color; black is none, red is 1, yellow is 2, and green is you completed all 3.
